# Sollar Panel

Sollar Panel is a documentation-first blueprint for an end-to-end IoT and machine learning pipeline that starts on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and ends with a containerized backend, live web dashboard, and dataset export flow for model training.

The current repository state is an architecture scaffold. It captures the edge-device requirements, server-side design, deployment constraints, and contributor rules before implementation starts.

## Features

- Resilient Raspberry Pi edge acquisition design for ADS1115 over I2C.
- MQTT-based ingestion with reconnect-safe behavior for unstable Wi-Fi and flaky sensor wiring.
- Time-series storage plan with `InfluxDB` as the default recommendation for a low-memory server.
- Feature engineering plan for deltas, rolling variance, and a heuristic illumination index.
- Daily dataset export path for Jupyter-based model training.
- Lightweight API and live dashboard plan with strict Docker isolation.
- Cloudflare Tunnel routing guidance that keeps the existing public site intact.

## Documentation

- [Project overview](docs/project-overview.md)
- [Edge device pipeline](docs/edge-device-pipeline.md)
- [Server pipeline](docs/server-pipeline.md)
- [Cloudflare Tunnel integration](docs/cloudflare-tunnel.md)
- [Repository operating rules](AGENT.md)

## Quickstart

This repository does not contain the production code yet. Start with the implementation docs and rules:

```bash
cd /home/tim/projects/sollar_panel
ls docs
sed -n '1,220p' docs/project-overview.md
sed -n '1,240p' AGENT.md
```

## Configuration

The planned runtime stack is:

- `mosquitto` for MQTT
- `influxdb` for time-series storage
- Python workers for ingestion and daily export
- `FastAPI` for history and live data delivery
- A separate frontend container for charts and status UI

The server design assumes a strict isolation boundary from the already-running public website and a constrained host with about `3 GB` of free RAM.

## Development

- Use English everywhere in the repository: code, comments, logs, API messages, UI text, and docs.
- Follow the workflow and operational rules in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md).
- When `README.md` needs to be revised, do it with the `github-readme` skill workflow.
- Keep documentation synchronized with behavior changes.

## Contributing

This project currently follows an internal, documentation-driven workflow. Before implementing or changing behavior:

1. Update the relevant spec in `docs/`.
2. Update `README.md` if onboarding or architecture expectations changed.
3. Update `AGENT.md` if the workflow or project rules changed.
4. Create a local commit for the change set and do not push unless the user explicitly asks for it.
