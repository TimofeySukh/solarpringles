# Sollar Panel

Sollar Panel is an end-to-end IoT and machine learning pipeline that starts on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and ends with a containerized backend, live command-center dashboard, and a phase-aware online-training loop for solar telemetry analysis.

The current repository state is a working MVP: the edge node samples ADS1115 voltage data at `1 Hz`, batches MQTT publishes every `5 seconds`, the server stores telemetry in InfluxDB, the ML engine trains a two-stage phase-plus-regression stack every 15 minutes, and the frontend renders a real-time analytical deck.

## Features

- Resilient Raspberry Pi edge acquisition for ADS1115 over I2C.
- MQTT-based ingestion with reconnect-safe behavior for unstable Wi-Fi and flaky sensor wiring.
- Edge-side batching that keeps local sampling at `1 Hz` while publishing 5-second aggregates to reduce Raspberry Pi and network load.
- Time-series storage plan with `InfluxDB` as the default recommendation for a low-memory server.
- Phase-aware online training service with feature engineering and two-stage models every 15 minutes.
- AI Insights for a light-only solar clock, sunset ETA, sunrise ETA, bias tracking, and confidence scoring.
- Command-center dashboard with live volatility, delta, residuals, percentiles, SNR, and uptime.
- Lightweight FastAPI surface for history, live telemetry, AI insights, and analytics summaries.
- Cloudflare Tunnel routing guidance that keeps the existing public site intact.

## Quickstart

Copy the environment template and start the server stack:

```bash
cd /home/tim/projects/sollar_panel
cp server/.env.example server/.env
docker compose --env-file server/.env -f server/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
docker compose --env-file server/.env -f server/docker-compose.yml ps
```

Default published ports:

- MQTT broker on `1884`
- InfluxDB UI and API on `127.0.0.1:18086`
- FastAPI scaffold on `127.0.0.1:18000`
- Frontend scaffold on `127.0.0.1:13000`

The repository also includes the Raspberry Pi edge node:

```bash
cp edge/.env.example edge/.env
python3 -m pip install -r edge/requirements.txt
python3 edge/solar_node.py
```

The default edge runtime behavior is:

- sample ADS1115 once per second
- append every successful sample to the local CSV backup
- publish one aggregate MQTT packet every `5 seconds`

## Configuration

The runtime stack is:

- `mosquitto` for MQTT
- `influxdb` for time-series storage
- Python workers for ingestion and daily export
- `ml_engine` for online model training and model registry refresh
- `FastAPI` for history, analytics, and live data delivery
- A separate frontend container for the command-center UI

The server design assumes a strict isolation boundary from the already-running public website and a constrained host with about `3 GB` of free RAM.

Initial server layout:

- `server/docker-compose.yml`
- `server/.env.example`
- `server/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`
- `server/backend/`
- `server/worker/`
- `server/ml_engine/`
- `server/frontend/`
- `server/data/exports/`

Edge layout:

- `edge/solar_node.py`
- `edge/.env.example`
- `edge/requirements.txt`
- `edge/systemd/sollar-panel-edge.service`

The backend now exposes:

- `GET /api/history` for aggregated day data
- `GET /api/live` as an SSE stream for real-time telemetry
- `GET /api/insights` for online-training output and confidence scores
- `GET /api/analytics` for last-hour percentiles, SNR, uptime, live volatility, delta, residual series, latest engineered features, and phase prediction
- `GET /api/status` for a compact runtime summary

The frontend is a single-file dashboard that proxies API traffic through Nginx and renders:

- a daily voltage area chart
- a 60-second live volatility oscilloscope
- a delta-per-second chart
- an adaptive AI residuals chart
- percentile, SNR, uptime, and confidence cards
- a bias card for the last-hour solar-clock drift
- an AI Insights panel for a light-only solar-clock estimate, sunset ETA, sunrise ETA, and ML phase context

The current ML stack includes:

- a phase classifier for `Night`, `Sunrise`, `Day`, `Sunset`, and `Anomaly`
- a time-of-day regressor for the AI solar clock estimate
- a day/sunset regressor for sunset ETA
- a night/sunrise regressor for sunrise ETA
- engineered features such as raw voltage, smoothed voltage, rolling standard deviation, multi-window deltas, and `voltage_to_daily_max_ratio`
- no `hour` or `minute` inputs for any live model, so the solar-clock estimate is driven purely by light behavior

## Development

- Use English everywhere in the repository: code, comments, logs, API messages, UI text, and docs.
- Follow the workflow and operational rules in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md).
- When `README.md` needs to be revised, do it with the `github-readme` skill workflow.
- Keep documentation synchronized with behavior changes.

## Contributing

This project currently follows an internal, documentation-driven workflow. Before implementing or changing behavior:

1. Update the relevant spec in `docs/`.
2. Update `README.md` if onboarding or architecture expectations changed.
3. Update `AGENT.md` if the workflow or project rules changed.
4. Create a local commit for the change set and do not push unless the user explicitly asks for it.
